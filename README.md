**Description**

---

Topic modeling is a technique used to discover the underlying structure in a set of text documents. It is commonly used in text analysis and text mining to identify key topics or themes in a corpus of documents.

There are several approaches to topic modeling, including:

**1. Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA):** It is a probabilistic statistical model that assigns words to topics based on their probability distribution in each document.

**2. Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA):** Also known as latent semantic analysis, it is a linear algebra-based technique that maps words and documents into a low-dimensional vector space where latent topics can be identified.

**3. Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF):** It is a dimensionality reduction technique that factors a term-document matrix into two term-topic and topic-document matrices, where the resulting matrices are non-negative.

**4. BERTopic:** It is a more recent approach that applies the BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) model to identify topics in a set of documents. It better captures the context and semantics of words.
